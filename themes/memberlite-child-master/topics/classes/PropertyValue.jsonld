This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery. For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the variableMeasured is \"depression rating\", the measurementTechnique could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique.","ExpectedTypes":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Text, http:\/\/schema.org\/URL","FirstLevel":"True"},{"Label":"minValue","Comment":"The lower value of some characteristic or property.","ExpectedTypes":"http:\/\/schema.org\/Number","FirstLevel":"True"},{"Label":"propertyID","Comment":"A commonly used identifier for the characteristic represented by the property, e.g. a manufacturer or a standard code for a property. propertyID can be (1) a prefixed string, mainly meant to be used with standards for product properties; (2) a site-specific, non-prefixed string (e.g. the primary key of the property or the vendor-specific id of the property), or (3) a URL indicating the type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
